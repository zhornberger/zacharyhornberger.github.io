I'm Zack Hornberger (he/him) and I am a second-year PhD student in the Industrial Engineering program at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana working under the advisement of Dr. Sheldon Jacobson and Dr. Douglas King.  My dissertation research focuses on counting processes and studying how the methods by which we collect data from a system influence our subsequent understanding of the process.  In addition, I am passionate about improving accessibility in STEM education and have broad interest in applied research with respect to workforce planning, emergency response, and education policy.  In relation to work, I am an Operations Research officer for the United States Air Force.  Throughout my military career, I have led numerous teams within the sphere of manpower planning, human resources, and business operations.

In my personal life, I enjoy being aggressively average at triathlons, knitting, and trivia nights.
