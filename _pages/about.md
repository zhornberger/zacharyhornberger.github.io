I'm Zack Hornberger (he/him) and I am a second-year PhD student in the Industrial Engineering program at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana working under the advisement of Dr. Sheldon Jacobson and Dr. Douglas King as well as an Operations Research officer in the United States Air Force.  My dissertation research focuses on counting processes and studying how the methods by which we collect data from a system influence our subsequent understanding of the process.  I have broad interest in applied research with respect to workforce planning, emergency response, and education policy.  For more details, please see either my publications or portfolio.

Throughout my military career, I have led numerous teams within the sphere of manpower planning, human resources, and business operations.  Within these roles, I strove to combine empathetic leadership and a passion for problem-solving to develop members of my teams and tackle complex, multidisciplinary challenges.  For more details, please see either my resume or portfolio.

In my personal life, I enjoy being aggressively average at triathlons, knitting, and trivia nights.
