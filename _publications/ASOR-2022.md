excerpt: 'The US Air Force’s approach to retention and pay creates an expensive force that undercompensates those performing many of its most critical skills. Also, by overly focusing on retention for active duty personnel, the Air Force accepts a larger than necessary disconnect between personnel and authorizations, forces Air Reserve Components to spend increased time and resources on training and recruiting, and leaves the service vulnerable to severe human capital disruptions in a conflict or crisis. A two-pronged approach would modernize compensation based on quantifiable skill sets and change the regular Air Force’s retention-management outlook to encompass the Air Reserve Components. This quantitatively grounded cost-neutral or cost-saving solution will improve the system’s functioning and increase the Air Force’s ability to field appropriately experienced personnel during wartime.'
