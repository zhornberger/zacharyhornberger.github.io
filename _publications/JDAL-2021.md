title: "Analysis of the effects of spatiotemporal demand data aggregation methods on distance and volume errors"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-08-11-spatiotemporal-aggregation-methods
excerpt: 'Large/stochastic spatiotemporal demand datasets can prove intractable for location optimization problems, motivating the need for aggregation. However, demand aggregation induces errors. Significant theoretical research has been performed related to the modifiable areal unit problem, and the zone definition problem. Minimal research has been accomplished related to the specific issues inherent to spatiotemporal demand data, such as search and rescue data. We introduce and apply a framework for comparing both deterministic and stochastic aggregation methods using distance-and volume-based aggregation error metrics. We additionally apply weighted versions of these metrics to account for the reality that demand events are non-homogeneous. These metrics are applied to a large, highly variable, spatiotemporal demand dataset of search and rescue events in the Pacific ocean. Comparisons using these metrics are conducted between six quadrat aggregations of varying scales and two zonal distribution models using hierarchical clustering. As quadrat fidelity increases the distance-based aggregation error decreases, while the two deliberate zonal approaches further reduce this error while utilizing fewer zones. However, the higher fidelity aggregations detrimentally effect volume error. Additionally, by splitting the search and rescue dataset into training and test sets we show the stochastic zonal distribution aggregation method is effective at simulating actual future demands.'

Large/stochastic spatiotemporal demand datasets can prove intractable for location optimization problems, motivating the need for aggregation. However, demand aggregation induces errors.
