In personnel and manpower terminology, a requirement is a position in the workcenter that is needed to accomplish a mission.  In this presentation, I discussed the current method for determining manpower requirements for most workcenters and proposed a new method.  The proposed method leverages simulation to model the workload of offices, linear programming to allocate scarce human capital to offices across the Air Force to meet the workload demands, and regression analysis to investigate potential drivers of the workload.
