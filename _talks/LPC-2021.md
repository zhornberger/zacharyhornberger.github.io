In this presentation, I described a virtual data analytics training program we launched and the subsequent educational research we conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the training program.  The training program we developed was geared towards manpower analysts across the Air Force.  We leveraged a combination of Digital University modules, collaborative work, virtual office hours, and additional available resources to educate 230 manpower professionals from around the globe on topics related to data visualization and inferential statistics without incurring travel and per diem costs.  The training was developed using a project-based learning model, with manpower professionals applying the knowledge they learned each week towards the completion of collaborative projects.  Following the conclusion of the trial-run of this program, we used student pre- and post-course surveys as well as student conversations and project submissions to evaluate the effectiveness of the digital training program in general and group-work dynamics in a virtual environment.
