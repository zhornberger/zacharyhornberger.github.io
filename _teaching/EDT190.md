During my senior year of my undergraduate program, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant for Dr. Thomas Kopp's EDT190: Introduction to Teaching course.  My responsibilities in this role included grading, occassional instruction, and cultivating student engagement in the course.  Additionally, as one of Dr. Kopp's teaching assistants, I served on a university working group designed to help new professors develop their curriculum in a manner that was tailored to both the needs of the students and nature of the material.
