While stationed at the Pentagon, I served as the go-to instructor for the Data Visualization & Analytics portion of the two-week Manpower Staff Officer Course from approximately summer 2021 until spring 2022.  For this workshop, I developed a project-based module that informed students on considerations when planning an research project, common pitfalls when analyzing data, and best practices for telling a compelling data story.  Each time they held the workshop, I would travel to San Antonio for a day to instruct students and facilitate the project at the conclusion of the module wherein students took the skills we covered in the lessons to address brief real-world problems using manpower data.
