Prior to entering active duty with the Air Force, I worked full-time as a significent support needs paraprofessional at Woodmen-Roberts Elementary School.  In this role, I provided academic, social, behavioral, and emotional support to elementary school students with physical and cognitive disabilities. Additionally, I worked alongside the primary special education teacher to develop curriculum goals and teach lessons in her absence. As Woodmen-Roberts took an inclusive approach to special education, I also coordinated with teachers to develop inclusive learning environments and implemented differentiated learning strategies to tailor coursework to the specific ability levels of each student.
