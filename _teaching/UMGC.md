While stationed at Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, I worked as an adjunct faculty instructor with the University of Maryland Global Campus from August 2019 until March 2020.  In that capacity, I instructed two MATH 103 College Mathematics for servicemembers on base. The course was designed to introduce students to problem solving, equations, linear systems, graphs & functions, consumer mathematics & financial management, and probability & statistics.
